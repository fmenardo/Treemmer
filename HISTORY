Treemmer_v0.1_beta

- Compatible with joblib 0.11 and 0.12
- Changed the call of the stop options, now it is possible to call -X and -RTL several time in the same run. For example "-X 100 50 -RTL .95" will output a reduced tree with 100 leaves, one with 50 leaves and one with 95% of the originla tree length in the same run
